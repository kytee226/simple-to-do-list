# simple-to-do-list
It's my first website built up myself by referring from Youtube from the following link: https://youtu.be/G0jO8kUrg-I?si=ivH0RqMeOELjIpA0
Beside learning through the video, I also try to improve my coding skills and widen my knowledge about building up the website through communicating my ideas with Copilot so as to have a deepen understandings on how the website works.
It's a fun and quite interesting learning process to learn the relationship between HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Feel free to ask me anything!
